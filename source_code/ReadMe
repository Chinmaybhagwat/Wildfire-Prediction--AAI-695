Wildfire project

Data
 - We are creating the latitude and longitude grid of california map
 - We map the stations to the grids
 - Extract daily weather data of each station belonging to each grid
 - Map the fire incidents to the grid which already had the daily weather data. If a grid on a specific day has at least one fire incident, feature has_fire = 1

Data source
 - Fire incident: https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents
 - Weather data: http://ipm.ucanr.edu/WEATHER/about_weather.html
               : https://cimis.water.ca.gov/
               Data retrieval by user then FTP then login as guest

Handling data exception
 - Remove all the inactive stations and station that is active after 2013
 - Some stations don't have data on some days or years. Grid information for those dates is NaN
 - If grid has more than one station, average all the weather data according to the number of not-NaN data of all stations else Nan
 - If grid doesn't have station, find the nearest station to map
