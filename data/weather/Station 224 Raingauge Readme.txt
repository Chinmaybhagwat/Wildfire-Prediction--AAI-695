Note:  Data error from 2013 initial date to October 4 2016 resulting in underreporting of precipitation.  The rain gauge metric data 
in this FTP file should by multiplied by 2.54 to achieve the correct rainfall number.  Convert this to inches by dividing by 25.4. 
For example:  
Oct. 3, 2016 shows 0.7 millimeters of rainfall.  That number multiplied by 2.54 is 1.778 mm.  Then divided by 25.4 is 0.07 inches. 
Correct Rainfall measurements continue from Oct 5th 2016 and forward.  Website data has been corrected.
